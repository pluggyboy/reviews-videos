Video Placeholder Image

To create a video placeholder image for the plugin:

1. Open the video-placeholder.html file in a web browser
2. Take a screenshot of the placeholder element (the dark gray rectangle with the play icon)
3. Crop the screenshot to just the placeholder element
4. Save the image as "video-placeholder.jpg" in this directory

This placeholder image will be used for videos that don't have thumbnails, such as user-uploaded videos.

Alternatively, you can create your own placeholder image with the following specifications:
- Dimensions: 400x225 pixels (16:9 aspect ratio)
- Format: JPG or PNG
- File name: video-placeholder.jpg
